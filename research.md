My main research focus revolves around computational optimization and numerical linear algebra, in particular on efficient design and implementation of solvers for nonlinear optimization and its applications.

My current research interests include development of a framework for nonlinear optimization in the Julia language, multiple precision in optimization and machine learning, factorization-free methods, open-source sustainable research, and parameter optimization.

Iâ€™m equally interested in applied projects involving optimization and data science modelling and the solution of data science problems with practical approaches.
